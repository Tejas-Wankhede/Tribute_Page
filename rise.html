    <p>By the 16th Century, The Deccan region of India came under the rule of the Mughal Empire established in Delhi. The uplands of Maratha were captured by the Adilshahi Sultanate on its north, a tributary state of the Mughal Emperor.  Shahaji Bhonsle was established as the chieftain of this region which belonged to the family of Bhonsle clan. Later, he became a rebel and started campaigns and raids against the Mughal Empire establishing forts. However, he was supported by the Bijapur government but was never successful. So he had to run from fort to fort with his Jijabai and son Shivaji. The condition in which Shivaji grew up made him a great king later. 


        By 16, he had his band of fighters and continued the fight for Shahaji. In 1647, he took over the administration of Poona against the Bijapur government. This was a major step and led to conflict with Bijapur. Subsequently, in a concise period, he also captured the forts of Purandhara, Kondhana, and Chakan. Then Supa, Baramati, and Inderpuri came into control of Shivaji Maharaj. The loot gathered helped him to build a capital fort at Raigad. Shivaji Maharaj is more famous for the new military tactics he formulated and used to fight his enemies in such terrains. This new method of gorilla tactics helped him to capture many forts within no time and brought a significant portion of the region under his control.
        
        
        Bijapur government became conscious of his wins and imprisoned Shahaji in 1648. After his release in a year, Shivaji Maharaj stayed low and consolidated the region under his rule. In 1656 he again began his raids and campaigns and captured the valley of Javali near Mahabaleshwar. Additionally, Shivaji Maharaj successfully subdued many other families with Deshmukhi rights under Adilshah of Bijapur. 
        
        
        In conclusion, Shivaji's life was full of hostilities with the kingdoms surrounding the Maratha region and also allianced to fight the wars. Finally, he established the Kingdom of Maratha and is still remembered as a great king of India.</p>

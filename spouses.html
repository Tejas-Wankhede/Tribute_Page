    <p>Shivaji Maharaj had several wives and two sons. His elder son, at one stage, defeated the Mughals and was brought back with the utmost difficulty.  Many are unaware of the fact that Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj has eight wives. His first wife was Saibai, also known as Nimbalkar. 

 

        The names of the other wives were Soyarabai, Mohite, Putalabai, Palkar, Sakvarbi Gaikwad, Sangunabai, and Kashibai Jadhav. His first wife, Saibai, bore him Sambhaji and three daughters. Soyarabai bore him a son named Rajaram and a daughter named Deepabai. His other children were Rajkunvarbai from his wife Sagunabai and Kamlabai from Sakvarbai. In 1659, his first wife, Saibai, passed away at a very young age due to a prolonged illness.
